# Why ?

I often limit my game ideas to singleplayer or local coop because of the complexity that a multiplayer game induces, and because I'm not comfortable with setting up such a project.

My goals with this research and a first prototype would be:

* Find a stack that is easy to set up (from project generation to deploying it online)
* If possible open-source libraries to help the community by finding bugs and writing documentation
